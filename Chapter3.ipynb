    "\"Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.\" (Wikipedia). \n",
    "This protocol is composed of a client side called ssh and a server side called SSHD. The client side logs into a remote machine and can execute command on said machine. This logging can be done using ssh keys which provides a more secure method of authentification than using a password. Even though SSH was meant for unix systems at the beginning, it is popular enough that a tool for windows was created: OpenSSH. 2 years ago windows launched their terminal which also supports SSH. \n",

    "Now our goal will be to create our own SSHkeys. To do this you have two options:\n",
    "- PuTTy https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html. You can then use PuTTYgen to generate your keys (Some server will require a specific format, for example the OpenSSH format. to convert the one you got from PuTTY you can use this command line in the terminal) .\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure this email is the same as on the websites you will use this SSH key on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want an additional security make sure to create a passphrase. If you do and dealing with it is to annoying make sure to create an agent (on windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52113738/starting-ssh-agent-on-windows-10-fails-unable-to-start-ssh-agent-service-erro and dont forget to have OpenSSH)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have a public and a private key. The private key can be use to generate the public key. **Never share your private key**. You need to give your public key to the server side but never the private. You will use the private when login onto the SSHD.\n",
